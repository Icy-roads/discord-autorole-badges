# discord-autorole-badges
Hello,

This is the purpose of this coding: As someone comes to your discord server, if that person has a badge, the example automatically assigns the "HypeSquad Events" role.

If you didn't do it right or think you didn't, my discord server is here: https://discord.gg/CSBJNTWW3V

Cheers,
Mission creator
